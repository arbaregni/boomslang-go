## What?

A satire of the python programming language


## Features

### Expressive Natural Language Syntax

Boomslang uses a sleek and readable syntax, designed not merely to be "executable pseudo code", but executable English.
This lowers the barrier of entry and makes it a great choice for any newcomers to the world of coding.
For example, in your typical "Hello world" program, newcomers must learn many new confusing concepts, just to show some text on their screen.
```python
print("Hello world")
```
You need to learn some weird outdated vocabulary ("print"? I don not even own a printer!), and are burdened with such syntactical machinery as parenthesis and string quoting. 
Boomslang makes this much easier, by letting you just say what you want to happen:
```
show text Hello world!
```
Much easier.

### Reduced Error Checking

Most developers do not like it when a compiler tells them their program is wrong.
Heck, most people do not like to be told they are wrong!
That is why Boomslang adopts a friendly approach by getting rid of this tedious correction process.
We will try our best to make it work for you.
And, if at the last possible second, the Boomslang runtime detects that something really can not work, it will let you know in a properly apologetic tone:

ü§ì Ummm ackshually this doesnt look like the correct type stop and fix it please
üòé Just fail in production

This is widely accepted as the fastiest and easiest way to get code into the hands of paying customers.

### Extensibility

It integrates seamlessly with anything. If you can think of it, it will probably work!
Boomslang has wormed its way into just about every

Disclaimer: this has not been verified. But, if you are asking for that, you are probably one of those masochistic sticklers and should go use one of those other torture devices you call a programming language.


### Standard Libraries

Most people love a batteries included approach that lets you get starting writing the application logic right away.
That is why Boomslang ships with not one, but 2 backwards incompatible standard libraries!
Yes, you heard that right.
Boomslang 2 has been almost usurped by Boomslang 3.
Imagine if you order an as-seen-on-TV remote helicopter and they send you some extra AAA batteries.
What a great deal, you can not get that anywhere else!

### Cross Platform

Boomslang* runs on anything.
It might be boomslang 2, or boomslang 3, however this is easily worked around
Just right your programs in the common subset between the too languages and you should be find.„ÄÄLuckily, thanks to our error handling paradigm, you will not know until it has already happenedÔºÅ
Get your shit out there, let someone else worry about the consequences.

### Applications 
Boomslang is great for back-end web develeopment, big data analysis, scripting, automation, prompt engineering, block chain, quantum computing, disruptive engineering, share holder valueing and much more.


## Why should I use?

Maybe do not use this.
